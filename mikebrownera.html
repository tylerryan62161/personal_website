                <p class="left_align">Mike Brown, successor to his father, Paul Brown, is among the most notorious figures in the history of Cincinnati sports. While the results from Mike's efforts leave little to debate, the motives behind his actions are scrutinized by a dejected fan base almost daily. The most prominent belief held by fans is that he doesn't care about the success of the franchise and merely uses the team to line his own pockets. We'll explore this reputation, how it was earned, and if it's justified.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border_div" style="text-align: center;">
                <h3>A Losing Legacy</h3>
                <p class="left_align"> Mike genuinely cares about the team and wants them to be successful. He wants to make his father proud and honor his legacy and he has attempted to emulate his father using the same methods as him. However, where Paul Brown had the appropriate experience and skills necessary to act as both owner and general manager, his son was only qualified to act as owner. As the NFL has modernized, only one other franchise (Dallas Cowboys) has a single person as acting owner and GM, and they have also struggled to remain competitive. That didn't stop Mike from declaring himself the general manager and paying himself a bonus every year since 1991 for assuming the title. Here are several statistics that accurately portray the quality of Mike's performance:</p>
                <p></p>
                <ul class="left_align">
                    <li>Seven winning seasons in 30 years as owner/GM</li>
                    <li>Took 15 years to produce his first winning season</li>
                    <li>In the seven years that his teams made the playoffs, they immediately lost in the first round</li>
                    <li>Secured the longest playoff victory drought of 30 years</li>
                    <li>Slowest owner to win 100 games ever</li>
                    <li>Quickest owner to lose 200 games ever</li>
                    <li>Personally holds 24% of the total 0-6 season starts in the NFL</li>
                    <li>Personally holds 31% of the total 0-8 season starts in the NFL</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">The good news is he has largely relinquished his control of the franchise in recent years. The bad news is that it comes in the form of more nepotism, which had disturbing results the last time around. So as Mike's time as the owner comes to a close and was objectively a colossal failure, how should we remember him? Yes, he gave himself responsibilities he was unqualified for. Yes, he was loyal to a fault and his frugality hindered the team. But is his reputation of not caring about the team's performance and only caring about money deserved? Here are some parting thoughts from players and coaches who played a big role in the team's history:</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>"He (Mike Brown) has put up with so much for you guys." - Marvin Lewis addressing players after upsetting an undefeated team in reference to Mike's public opinion</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>"Mike Brown is a nice man who is simply over his head running the team" - Boomer Esiason</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>"I don't think anybody could be suffering more over this than Mike is." - Dave Lapham and Cris Collinsworth</p>

                <h3>Father's Footsteps</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">Mike was born in Massillon, Ohio in 1935. You may remember from the page on Paul Brown that this was during Paul's coaching tenure at Massillon Washington High School. Mike never lived in a world where his father wasn't being idolized for his football prowess and resulting success. He grew up reading the same headlines as everyone else at the time proclaiming his father to be the greatest coach in football history. He was even fortunate enough to spend time with the players from Paul's various teams through college and the pros. Mike has expressed how those moments, being able to meet and interact with his favorite players regularly as a child, will always stick with him. They were his heroes. It didn't take long for him to fall in love with the game just like dear, old dad.</p>
                <p></p>

                <h3>Assistant General Manager</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">Mike didn't immediately seek employment with his father. He graduated Dartmouth College, where he played QB for their football team, before graduating from Harvard Law School in 1959. His father would run the Cleveland Browns all the way until 1963. After Paul was fired, Mike received a phone call from his father, saying</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>“He called me on the phone and he said that his team had been taken away from him. That was the phrase he used. His voice broke. That was something that had never really happened with him talking to me. It was the sky falling in on him. My goal came to be to try to help him re-establish himself.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">Up until this point Mike was working as a lawyer in Cleveland. Five years later, he would accomplish his goal of re-establishing his father by helping Paul secure ownership of the new American Football League franchise being established in Cincinnati, Ohio. Mike was rewarded by receiving the position of assistant general manager to his father. His responsibilities included personnel decsions and being a team spokesman in regards to team policy and league rules.</p>

                <h3>Owner/General Manager</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">Paul Brown passed away in 1991, clearing the way for Mike to become the owner and general manager of the team. No one had a true sense of what, if anything, would change as the leadership transitioned from father to son. They soon would. Mike's first big decision was to fire the head coach after his first season as owner. That head coach was popular amongst fans at the time and this decision was met with public backlash. Mike followed this up by hiring a replacement head coach who would go on to have one of the worst NFL coaching records in history. Mike's tenure and public perception was not off to a good start, and it was only going to get worse.</p>

                <p class="left_align">In the midst of his handpicked coach's historically bad run, Mike decided it was time to build a new stadium. The general idea was supported but the method he used to fund the stadium is a source of contention to this day. Mike argued a modern stadium was necessary to make the team more competitive in the future. He threatened to move the team to a different city if Cincinnati or Hamilton County didn't fund the new stadium. It worked. The new stadium came to be funded by a 0.5% increase to the sales tax in Hamilton County. In 2000, after Hamilton County taxpayers funded the construction of the stadium, the Bengals sued the county for the right to manage it. They won that suit before the stadium opened later that year. From the fans' perspective, they had remained loyal to a team that had just experienced one of the most futile decades in all of professional sports only to be forced to pay for the new stadium or watch the team leave. It's easy to see where contempt for Mike Brown originated and why it has strong roots.</p>

                <h3>Loyalty and Frugality</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">Mike's two biggest issues have stemmed from loyalty and frugality. Loyalty might sound like a positive character trait but in this business, it's decisively a disadvantage. As for frugality, it has reared its ugly head directly in player contracts but also in more ancillary aspects of the team. Let's start with loyalty. Mike has only ever tried to emulate his father and make him proud. When it came time to name the new stadium he had built, Mike opted to name it Paul Brown Stadium after his father instead of offering naming rights to the highest corporate bidder, which is comonplace in the league. The problem is, Mike didn't inherit his father's ability to masterfully compile talent and steer that talent to victory. Most people don't have this ability, but there has been nobody in a position to challenge Mike or hold him accountable. He is the dictator of the Cincinnati Bengals. Mike thinks he always knows best and he only answers to himself. Hence, this is why there has been 30 years of futility without significant changes until recently. These changes will be discussed on the Katie Blackburn page of this site.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">Continuing with Mike's loyalty being a detriment, it has affected the team negatively in many areas. Even though his family members have all graduated with impressive degrees from impressive universities, nepotism rarely works out for any organization. This is how Mike became owner in the first place. Now that cycle has continued with the next generation of Mike's family receiving all of the most powerful and high paying roles on the team. While I hold hope for his daughter Katie, this is still a troubling trend that will create more problems than it solves. Beyond front office positions, Mike has been too loyal to his coaches. He exercises more patience with them than is the norm, and these coaches hold several records for how terribly they performed over sustained periods of time. These records include being the fastest coach to 50 losses and having coached the most games in history without a single playoff win. Finally, with players, he has inserted undeserving players into starting roles, kept aging players on big contracts past their primes, and forgiven numerous run-ins with the law. In these ways, Mike's loyalty has hampered the team's ability to compete.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">Now let's discuss Mike's frugality. He is a shrewd business man and as mentioned earlier has experience practicing law with his degree from Harvard Law School. He presumably utilized this experience and knowledge when he negotiated the deal with Hamilton County and Cincinnati to fund the stadium. And again when he sued for control of the stadium after it was built.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>“You cut the cloth according to need." - Mike Brown</p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="left_align">This is his quote in reference to his spending habits versus other teams in the league. Players have complained he limits how many gatorades they get per practice. They've also stated how other teams would fly them in first class while Mike would set them up in coach. His history of losing and his frugality have created a viscious cycle for the team whereby players require more money in free agency to accept a deal with a historically bad franchise and how Mike likes to undercut fair value contracts. More simply put, he tries to underpay players and players will only join bad teams if the bad teams overpay. This has lead to great difficulty attracting talented players to the team or retaining home grown players acquired through the draft.</p>
